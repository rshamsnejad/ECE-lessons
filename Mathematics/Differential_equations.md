# Differential equations

## 1st order solving

#### Definition

A 1st order differential equation is like so:

$ \boxed{a(t) \times y'(t) + b(t) \times y(t) = c(t)} $

Where $a(t)$, $b(t)$ and $c(t)$ are know coefficients, and $y(t)$ is the unknown equation we're looking for.

#### Solving steps

##### Step 1 : solve without $c(t)$

First we need to solve the following equation :

$ \boxed{ a(t) \times y'(t) + b(t) \times y(t) = 0 } $

The solution is :

$ \boxed{ f(t) = k \times e^{-G(t)} } $
with $ k \in \R $ and $ G(t) $ a primitive of $ \frac{b(t)}{a(t)} $
